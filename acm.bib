abstract = {Mirrly is a new humanoid robot designed to facilitate human-robot social interactions, focusing on applications in therapy and education for children. Inspired by the need for engaging and effective interactions, Mirrly’s design incorporates a friendly appearance, articulated expressive face, and multimodal interaction capabilities. A key goal of designing Mirrly was keeping costs low while still retaining affective and expressive qualities of the robot. This paper presents the process of development and design of Mirrly. We also delve into the decisions we made to choose and design hardware, software, and interactions. By comparing existing robots and exploring implications for future research, Mirrly demonstrates the potential for advancing Child-Robot Interaction in many application areas. The open-source nature of Mirrly’s platform further encourages collaboration and innovation in the research community, offering a versatile and potentially impactful platform for a diverse range of applications in human-robot social interactions.},

First, we give some background to generative AI in HCI, arguing that current interaction techniques prevent us from directly interacting with the material of AI, foreclosing its use in design. Drawing on inspiration from the Computer Science field of feature visualization, we investigate the materiality of our prototype, a GAN model trained to generate fashion imagery, and show how Hidden Layer Interaction offers an alternative to standard prompting. In doing so, we illustrate how this change in approach leads to new forms of interaction with the internal semantics of generative AI, and demonstrate how one might use Hidden Layer Interaction to engage with AI as a material in design.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to a big quality drop.In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a caching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving efficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models as in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed the compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts, enabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving this live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between response quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache efficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new request's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality offline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency. Evaluations on millions of realistic requests demonstrate that IC-Cache improves LLM serving throughput by 1.4–5.9x and reduces latency by 28–71% without hurting response quality.},

abstract = {The task of code generation aims to generate code solutions based on given programming problems. Recently, code large language models (code LLMs) have shed new light on this task, owing to their formidable code generation capabilities. While these models are powerful, they seldom focus on further improving the accuracy of library-oriented API invocation. Nonetheless, programmers frequently invoke APIs in routine coding tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance the proficiency of existing code LLMs regarding API invocation by mimicking analogical learning, which is a critical learning strategy for humans to learn through differences among multiple instances. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely DiffCoder, which excels in API invocation by effectively training on the differences (diffs) between analogical code exercises. To assess the API invocation capabilities of code LLMs, we conduct experiments on seven existing benchmarks that focus on mono-library API invocation. Additionally, we construct a new benchmark, namely PanNumEval, to evaluate the performance of multi-library API invocation. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate the impressive performance of DiffCoder. Furthermore, we develop a VSCode plugin for DiffCoder, and the results from twelve invited participants further verify the practicality of DiffCoder.},

abstract = {The rise of large language model-based code generation (LLCG) has enabled various commercial services and APIs. Training LLCG models is often expensive and time-consuming, and the training data are often large-scale and even inaccessible to the public. As a result, the risk of intellectual property (IP) theft over the LLCG models (e.g., via imitation attacks) has been a serious concern. In this paper, we propose the first watermark (WM) technique to protect LLCG APIs from remote imitation attacks. Our proposed technique is based on replacing tokens in an LLCG output with their "synonyms" available in the programming language. A WM is thus defined as the stealthily tweaked distribution among token synonyms in LLCG outputs. We design six WM schemes (instantiated into over 30 WM passes) which rely on conceptually distinct token synonyms available in programming languages. Moreover, to check the IP of a suspicious model (decide if it is stolen from our protected LLCG API), we propose a statistical tests-based procedure that can directly check a remote, suspicious LLCG API.We evaluate our WM technique on LLCG models fine-tuned from two popular large language models, CodeT5 and CodeBERT. The evaluation shows that our approach is effective in both WM injection and IP check. The inserted WMs do not undermine the usage of normal users (i.e., high fidelity) and incur negligible extra cost. Moreover, our injected WMs exhibit high stealthiness and robustness against powerful attackers; even if they know all WM schemes, they can hardly remove WMs without largely undermining the accuracy of their stolen models.},

abstract = {The advancement of automated driving technologies is fundamentally transforming the relationship between humans and vehicles, shifting from direct control to a more collaborative dynamic. Consequently, the design of in-vehicle Human-Machine Interfaces (iHMIs) is becoming increasingly intricate, focusing on aspects beyond mechanics and ergonomics towards enriched interaction and enhanced user experience. This shift has prompted research efforts to explore and advance iHMI concepts. Despite the iterative nature of design and its role in knowledge creation, our high-level understanding of the design processes utilised in iHMI development remains limited. To provide a comprehensive overview, this paper presents a scoping review of 324 papers (2013—2023) focused on the design underpinnings of iHMI development. Our review presents a categorisation of study goals and a detailed classification of five key stages within the design process. Based on these analyses, we discuss the influence of design and identify potential avenues for future research on iHMIs.},

The review highlights a trend in evaluating healthcare professionals (especially surgeons) motivated by the critical role of hands-on training in these professions. Besides, the review reveals that data fusion techniques and certain technologies, like transfer learning and explainable AI, are not widely utilized despite their huge potential. Finally, the review underscores that most proposals remain within the research domain, lacking the integration and maturity needed for sustained use in real-world environments. Therefore, most of the proposals are not currently available to support the training of professionals. The insights of this review can guide researchers aiming to improve the training of professionals and, consequently, their education.},

One reason for this high variance in terminology is the unique array of social cues that embodied agents can access in contrast to that accessed by non-embodied agents. Another reason is that different authors use these terms in different ways. Hence, we review the existing literature on explainability and organize it by (1) providing an overview of existing definitions, (2) showing how explainability is implemented and how it exploits different social cues, and (3) showing how the impact of explainability is measured. Additionally, we present a list of open questions and challenges that highlight areas that require further investigation by the community.

abstract = {Background. Software vulnerabilities are increasing in complexity and scale, posing great security risks to many software systems. Extracting information about software vulnerabilities is a critical area of research that aims to identify and create a structured representation of vulnerability-related information. This structured data helps software systems better understand vulnerabilities and provides security professionals with timely information to mitigate the impact of rapidly growing vulnerabilities while guiding future research to develop more secure systems. However, this process relies on the effectiveness of information extraction to transform manual vulnerability analysis from security experts to digital solutions. Despite its importance, the unique nature of vulnerability information and the fast pace at which machine learning-based extraction methods and techniques have evolved make it challenging to assess the current successes, failures, challenges, and opportunities within this research area. This study presents a systematic literature review aimed at clarifying this complex landscape.Methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore existing research focusing on extracting information about software security vulnerabilities. We search for 829 primary studies on security vulnerability information extraction from seven widely used online digital libraries, focusing on top peer-reviewed journals and conferences published between 2001 and 2024. After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we narrowed our selection to 87 studies for in-depth analysis and addressed four main research questions. We collect qualitative and quantitative data from each study, identifying 34 components such as research problems, methods, contributions, evaluation metrics, results, types of extracted vulnerability information, challenges, and limitations. We use meta-analysis, statistical machine learning, and text-mining techniques to identify themes, patterns, and trends across the primary studies and visualize findings.Results. The study provides an overview of the security vulnerability data landscape, identifies key resources, and guides efforts to improve vulnerability information extraction and analysis. The study finds a diverse landscape of learning algorithms used in security vulnerability information extraction, with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) being the most dominant. The study identifies key challenges, including feature engineering complexity, lack of a gold-standard corpus, preprocessing errors, generating accurate training data, addressing imbalanced data, multimodality fusion, and graph sparsity in security knowledge graphs.Insights for Future Research Directions. The study underscores the need for advanced extraction approaches, robust datasets, automated annotation methods, and advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the extraction of security vulnerability information. This study also suggests using large language models (LLMs) and transformer models to facilitate the automatic extraction of security-related words, terms, concepts, and phrases and introduce new filtering parameters for user requirements.

abstract = {For synergistic interactions between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, AI outputs often need to be explainable to people. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are commonly tested in human user studies. However, whether XAI researchers consider potential cultural differences in human explanatory needs remains unexplored. We highlight psychological research that found significant differences in human explanations between many people from Western, commonly individualist countries and people from non-Western, often collectivist countries. We argue that XAI research currently overlooks these variations and that many popular XAI designs implicitly and problematically assume that Western explanatory needs are shared cross-culturally. Additionally, we systematically reviewed over 200 XAI user studies and found that most studies did not consider relevant cultural variations, sampled only Western populations, but drew conclusions about human-XAI interactions more generally. We also analyzed over 30 literature reviews of XAI studies. Most reviews did not mention cultural differences in explanatory needs or flag overly broad cross-cultural extrapolations of XAI user study results. Combined, our analyses provide evidence of a cultural bias toward Western populations in XAI research, highlighting an important knowledge gap regarding how culturally diverse users may respond to widely used XAI systems that future work can and should address.},

abstract = {The human aspects of cyber security are fundamental as these are interlinked with processes and technology in building resilience against an evolving and complex threat landscape. It is vital to teach future cyber security specialists sufficient knowledge about human aspects in order to strengthen the defences and defend against malicious actors. The challenges in the cyber security course and curriculum design in higher education arise from ambiguity of what is meant by ‘human aspects’ in cyber security and differing demands of a multitude of cyber security job profiles. As a result, choosing what human aspects knowledge and skills to teach and balancing this with technical content is a multiplex problem. We review the existing cyber security curricular guidance on the human aspects and perform a systematic literature review of academic research. The review covers what human aspects content is included in existing cyber security courses and curricula, what are the design philosophies and pedagogical approaches to teaching human aspects and how the effectiveness of the content coverage and pedagogical approaches is evaluated in higher education with cyber security specialisation. The main findings are that although high-level guidance is available, there is no academic agreement and common vocabulary on the human aspects of cyber security. The research covering teaching human aspects is often very high level or focuses on a narrow topic (e.g., social engineering). The published research and sharing knowledge on the pedagogical approaches and evaluation varies in quality and is often published based on the USA’s universities’ experience. The interdisciplinary approach in cyber security, where human behaviour is a crucial component (i.e., human-centric cyber security), has been discussed for years. However, only when giving enough human aspects focus in the curricula and choosing appropriate pedagogical approaches will academia shape the future of cyber security education to achieve this goal.},

abstract = {Loop invariant inference, a key component in program verification, is a challenging task due to the inherent undecidability and complex loop behaviors in practice. Recently, machine learning based techniques have demonstrated impressive performance in generating loop invariants automatically. However, these methods highly rely on the labeled training data, and are intrinsically random and uncertain, leading to unstable performance. In this paper, we investigate a synergy of large language models (LLMs) and bounded model checking (BMC) to address these issues. The key observation is that, although LLMs may not be able to return the correct loop invariant in one response, they usually can provide all individual predicates of the correct loop invariant in multiple responses. To this end, we propose a "query-filter-reassemble" strategy, namely, we first leverage the language generation power of LLMs to produce a set of candidate invariants, where training data is not needed. Then, we employ BMC to identify valid predicates from these candidate invariants, which are assembled to produce new candidate invariants and checked by off-the-shelf SMT solvers. The feedback is incorporated into the prompt for the next round of LLM querying. We expand the existing benchmark of 133 programs to 316 programs, providing a more comprehensive testing ground. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, successfully generating 309 loop invariants out of 316 cases, whereas the existing baseline methods are only able to tackle 219 programs at best.

abstract = {Document Visual Question Answering (DVQA) involves responding to queries based on the contents of document images. Existing works are confined to locating information within a single page and lack support for cross-page question-and-answer interactions. Furthermore, the token length limitation on model inputs can lead to the truncation of answer-relevant segments. In this study, we present CREAM, an innovative methodology that focuses on high-performance retrieval and integrates relevant multimodal document information to effectively address this critical issue. To overcome the limitations of current text embedding similarity methods, we first employ a coarse-to-fine retrieval and ranking approach. The coarse phase calculates the similarity between the query and text chunk embeddings, while the fine phase involves multiple rounds of grouping and ordering with a large language model to identify the text chunks most relevant to the query. Subsequently, integrating an attention pooling mechanism for multi-page document images into the vision encoder allows us to effectively merge the visual information of multi-page documents, enabling the multimodal large language model (MLLM) to simultaneously process both single-page and multi-page documents. Finally, we apply various parameter-efficient tuning methods to enhance document visual question-answering performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach secures state-of-the-art results across various document datasets.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to its integration into various areas, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhancing capabilities in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). However, the complexity of AI systems has also exposed their vulnerabilities, necessitating robust methods for failure analysis (FA) and fault injection (FI) to ensure resilience and reliability. Despite the importance of these techniques, there lacks a comprehensive review of FA and FI methodologies in AI systems. This study fills this gap by presenting a detailed survey of existing FA and FI approaches across six layers of AI systems. We systematically analyze 142 studies to answer three research questions including (1) what are the prevalent failures in AI systems, (2) what types of faults can current FI tools simulate, (3) what gaps exist between the simulated faults and real-world failures. Our findings reveal a taxonomy of AI system failures, assess the capabilities of existing FI tools, and highlight discrepancies between real-world and simulated failures. Moreover, this survey contributes to the field by providing a framework for fault diagnosis, evaluating the state-of-the-art in FI, and identifying areas for improvement in FI techniques to enhance the resilience of AI systems.},

abstract = {ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. However, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant challenge to their adoption in a typical software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server to develop code. Such large models cost significant resources in terms of memory, latency, dollars, as well as carbon footprint. Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges. We have identified quantization as one of the most promising compression techniques for code-generation as it avoids expensive retraining costs. As quantization represents model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and runtime latency would both benefit. We empirically evaluate quantized models on code generation tasks across different dimensions: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. Through systematic experiments we find a code-aware quantization recipe that could run even a 6-billion-parameter model in a regular laptop without significant accuracy or robustness degradation. We find that the recipe is readily applicable to code summarization task as well.},

We reviewed 66 publications from 5 databases and the TEI conference proceedings (2010-2024). We examined each one according to the medical fields concerned, the targeted audience, the type of contribution and the purposes, the evaluation process, the artifacts, and their impact on Healthcare. Four key findings were: (1) The potential of TUIs has not yet been explored in all health fields; (2) The primary purposes of TUIs are facilitating diagnosis, promoting active aging, and improving the rehabilitation process; (3) The artifacts are mainly motivating, easy to use, and low-cost; (4) Familiarity is an essential criterion for the design process.},

abstract = {In this work, we review research studies that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLMs), two areas that owe their momentum to the development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose a novel taxonomy of three main classes based on the way that the two model types interact with each other. The first class, RL4LLM, includes studies where RL is leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). RL4LLM is divided into two sub-categories depending on whether RL is used to directly fine-tune an existing LLM or to improve the prompt of the LLM. In the second class, LLM4RL, an LLM assists the training of an RL model that performs a task that is not inherently related to natural language. We further break down LLM4RL based on the component of the RL training framework that the LLM assists or replaces, namely reward shaping, goal generation, and policy function. Finally, in the third class, RL+LLM, an LLM and an RL agent are embedded in a common planning framework without either of them contributing to training or fine-tuning of the other. We further branch this class to distinguish between studies with and without natural language feedback. We use this taxonomy to explore the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL and explain the reasons for its success, while pinpointing potential shortcomings and areas where further research is needed, as well as alternative methodologies that serve the same goal.},

abstract = {AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

abstract = {As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating indistinguishable instances - those that have the same observable features - as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial, and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However, we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm. Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.},

Working Groups are now part of CompEd and SIGCSE Virtual. An ITiCSE Working Group is typically composed of 8-12 researchers who work together for about nine months on a research project related to computing education. Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers. This unique experience is one that, in our opinion, each Computer Science Educator should strive to participate in at least once.In 2024, 13 proposals for Working Groups were received and ten Working Groups were selected by the Working Group chairs to recruit members and proceed for ITiCSE 2024. There were 166 member applications to Working Groups, with 134 being accepted including 33 Working Group leaders across the ten Working Groups. This is a record number of both Working Groups and Working Group members at a single conference.Working Groups began their work virtually from March up until the beginning of the ITiCSE conference. Their work included intensive collaboration on-site for the three days prior to the conference. A draft report was then submitted on the Sunday prior to the conference; a few weeks after the conference, the Working Groups submitted their final report for peer review.If the report was accepted for publication, the groups revised it based on the reviewers' comments and suggestions. This dedicated ITiCSE Working Group proceedings volume presents the final camera-ready version of the reports. We are glad that all ten papers were selected for publication in these proceedings for the ACM Digital Library.},

We define the “factuality issue” as the probability of LLMs to produce content inconsistent with established facts. We first delve into the implications of these inaccuracies. Subsequently, we analyze the mechanisms through which LLMs store and process facts, seeking the primary causes of factual errors. Our discussion then transitions to methodologies for evaluating LLM factuality, emphasizing key metrics, benchmarks, and studies. We further explore strategies for enhancing LLM factuality. Our survey offers a structured guide for researchers aiming to fortify the factual reliability of LLMs. We consistently maintain and update the related open-source materials at .},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.}

abstract = {Despite decades of research and practice in automated software testing, several fundamental concepts remain ill-defined and under-explored, yet offer enormous potential real-world impact. We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

abstract = {Recent years have seen a rise in Neural Program Repair (NPR) systems in the software engineering community, which adopt advanced deep learning techniques to automatically fix bugs. Having a comprehensive understanding of existing systems can facilitate new improvements in this area and provide practical instructions for users. However, we observe two potential weaknesses in the current evaluation of NPR systems: ① published systems are trained with varying data, and ② NPR systems are roughly evaluated through the number of totally fixed bugs. Questions such as what types of bugs are repairable for current systems cannot be answered yet. Consequently, researchers cannot make target improvements in this area and users have no idea of the real affair of existing systems. In this article, we perform a systematic evaluation of the existing nine state-of-the-art NPR systems. To perform a fair and detailed comparison, we (1) build a new benchmark and framework that supports training and validating the nine systems with unified data and (2) evaluate re-trained systems with detailed performance analysis, especially on the effectiveness and the efficiency. We believe our benchmark tool and evaluation results could offer practitioners the real affairs of current NPR systems and the implications of further facilitating the improvements of NPR.},

abstract = {Python’s dynamic typing nature provides developers with powerful programming abstractions. However, many type-related bugs are accumulated in code bases of Python due to the misuse of dynamic typing. The goal of this article is to aid in the understanding of developers’ high-risk practices toward dynamic typing and the early detection of type-related bugs. We first formulate the rules of six types of risky dynamic typing-related practices (type smells for short) in Python. We then develop a rule-based tool named RUPOR, which builds an accurate type base to detect type smells. Our evaluation shows that RUPOR outperforms the existing type smell detection techniques (including the Large Language Models–based approaches, Mypy, and PYDYPE) on a benchmark of 900 Python methods. Based on RUPOR, we conduct an empirical study on 25 real-world projects. We find that type smells are significantly related to the occurrence of post-release faults. The fault-proneness prediction model built with type smell features slightly outperforms the model built without them. We also summarize the common patterns, including inserting type check to fix type smell bugs. These findings provide valuable insights for preventing and fixing type-related bugs in the programs written in dynamic-typed languages.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort.

abstract = {Understanding user behaviors on social media has garnered significant scholarly attention, enhancing our comprehension of how virtual platforms impact society and empowering decision-makers. Simulating social media behaviors provides a robust tool for capturing the patterns of social media behaviors, testing hypotheses, and predicting the effects of various interventions, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of social media environments. Moreover, it can overcome difficulties associated with utilizing real data for analysis, such as data accessibility issues, ethical concerns, and the complexity of processing large and heterogeneous datasets. However, researchers and stakeholders need more flexible platforms to investigate different user behaviors by simulating different scenarios and characters, which is not possible yet. Therefore, this paper introduces SimSpark, an interactive system including simulation algorithms and interactive visual interfaces which is capable of creating small simulated social media platforms with customizable characters and social environments. We address three key challenges: generating believable behaviors, validating simulation results, and supporting interactive control for generation and results analysis. A simulation workflow is introduced to generate believable behaviors of agents by utilizing large language models. A visual interface enables real-time parameter adjustment and process monitoring for customizing generation settings. A set of visualizations and interactions are also designed to display the models' outputs for further analysis. Effectiveness is evaluated through case studies, quantitative simulation model assessments, and expert interviews.},

abstract = {Integration, composition, mechanization, and AI assisted development are the driving themes in the future of software development. At their core these concepts are rooted in the increasingly important role of computing in our world, the desire to deliver functionality faster, with higher quality, and to empower more people to benefit from programmatic automation. These themes, and how they impact the human developers driving them, are the foundations for the next generation of programming languages. At first glance the needs of mechanization tools, AI agents, and human developers along with the various goals around development velocity, software quality, and software democratization are a broad and seemingly diverse set of needs. However, at their core is a single challenge that, once resolved, enables us to make radical progress in all of these areas. Our hypothesis is that, fundamentally, software development is a problem of reasoning about code and semantics. This is true for human developers implementing a feature, symbolic tools building models of application behaviour, and even for language based AI agents as they perform tasks. While the particular aspects of reasoning that each agent struggles with varies to some degree, they share many common themes and, surprisingly, most mainstream languages extensively employ (anti)features that make this task harder or infeasible! This paper proposes a novel approach to this challenge – instead of new language features or logical constructs, that add more complexity to what is already a problem of complexity, we propose radical simplification in the form of the Bosque platform and language.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan}

We extend the good practice of having a YouTube channel to view the talks during the symposium and afterward, improving access to the presentations.Across three days, ISPD 2025 has 3 keynotes, 18 accepted papers, 13 invited talks; one panel on Monday with 4 panelists; and 4 speakers with longer talks in Professor Jason Cong''s commemorative session, and finally the ISPD 2025 contest results.This year, we received a total of 64 abstracts and we received 48 full manuscripts, from which 18 were selected - a 37.5% acceptance rate. The regular papers in the ISPD 2025 program were selected, after a rigorous month-long double-blind review process and virtual meetings, by the Technical Program Committee with 20 outstanding international professionals from both academia and industry. These papers exhibit the latest advancements in a variety of topics in physical design, including global placement; mixed cell-height legalization; PCB placement; inverse lithography; quantum layout; photonic integrated circuits and side channel analysis; timing propagation; logic optimization; crosstalk mitigation; DRC checking; gate sizing; standard cell layout; CFET cell design; timing rule generation; analog cell design; 3D net-to-pad assignment, and 3D power delivery. A number of these papers utilize advanced mathematical programming, satisfiability modulo theories, GPU acceleration, and machine learning techniques.We are delighted to host three distinguished keynote speakers. The Monday keynote "Towards Designing and Deploying Ising Machines" will be given by Professor Sachin Sapatnekar of the University of Minnesota. He will explore opportunities for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems using Ising machines. The discussion will emphasize the layout and timing challenges specific to Ising machines that are based on coupled CMOS ring oscillators. On Tuesday morning, Dr. Charles J Alpert of Cadence Design Systems will present "How Automotive Functional Safety is Disrupting Digital Implementation". He will provide an overview of the challenges in achieving functional-safe ICs for automotive applications and discuss their impact on the digital implementation flow, including synthesis, placement, and routing. Wednesday's keynote is given by Dr. Henry Sheng from Synopsys on "Automation and Optimization of Heterogeneous Systems". He will explore the challenges and strategies for automating heterogeneous integration, an area that has traditionally relied on disconnected workflows and significant manual effort.The ISPD 2025 program is complemented by invited talks on topics ranging across design technology co-optimization; systolic array-based ICs; ECO automation, ML &amp; AI methods in design automation; 3D IC design and integration; power design and analysis; and an analysis of the historical impact of ISPD. Additionally, we have a panel discussing EDA challenges in heterogeneous integration.In the ISPD Lifetime Achievement Award session on Tuesday, we will pay tribute to Professor Jason Cong. This session highlights Professor Cong's pioneering contributions in the algorithmic aspects of the physical design of silicon chips. This session has talks from his mentor, labmate and former students. Dr Bryan Preas will present the Innovation in Times of Technology Disruption. Followed by the talk from Professor Martin Wong from Hong Kong Baptist University. Professor David Pan, from University of Texas at Austin, will discuss the future of interconnected Physical Design. Finally, Professor Jason Cong will also grace the symposium with a delightful talk on coping with interconnects and a recount of his numerous contributions in EDA and Physical Design..Since 2005, ISPD has organized highly competitive contests to promote and advance research in placement, global routing, clock network synthesis, gate sizing, detailed routing-driven placement, and hardware security. The contest this year features the second contest on GPU-accelerated and machine learning-enhanced large scale global routing. This time the contest integrates timing and power metric. The contest is again organized by NVIDIA. The contest aims to not only deliver substantial reductions in global routing runtime but take performance and power into account as required in real-world applications. This year's contest attracted 46 teams from all over the world, reaching a record high.This year, we continue with a short format for the invited talks and regular papers. Presentations are 12 minutes in length, plus about 5 minutes for questions and answers after each talk, and some time at the end of each session for open discussion. This format is intended to encourage discussion among our research community. The talks in the lifetime achievement session are 20 minutes in length, with 5 minutes for questions and answers. Keynotes remain about 40 minutes in length, with 10 minutes for discussion.},

We propose an architecture where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent guides an LLM's space exploration: (1) the Agent has access to domain-specific information, and can therefore make decisions about the quality of candidate solutions based on specific and relevant metrics, which were not explicitly considered by the LLM's training objective; (2) the LLM can focus on generating immediate next steps, without the need for long-term planning. We allow non-linear reasoning by exploring alternative paths and backtracking. We evaluate this architecture on the program equivalence task, and compare it against Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT). We assess both the downstream task, denoting the binary classification, and the intermediate reasoning steps. Our approach compares positively against CoT and ToT.},

DTDMat covers 20 intrinsic material types and 22 texture structures. It stands out as the most diverse dataset in this domain and represents the largest texture dataset with associated text, offering a wide range of categories and diverse descriptions. We then trained a text-to-material generation framework based on DTDMat, yielding multiple generated BRDF maps that satisfy the input text.},

We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

abstract = {Modern information querying systems are progressively incorporating multimodal inputs like vision and audio. However, the integration of gaze --- a modality deeply linked to user intent and increasingly accessible via gaze-tracking wearables --- remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel gaze-facilitated information querying paradigm, named G-VOILA, which synergizes users' gaze, visual field, and voice-based natural language queries to facilitate a more intuitive querying process. In a user-enactment study involving 21 participants in 3 daily scenarios (p = 21, scene = 3), we revealed the ambiguity in users' query language and a gaze-voice coordination pattern in users' natural query behaviors with G-VOILA. Based on the quantitative and qualitative findings, we developed a design framework for the G-VOILA paradigm, which effectively integrates the gaze data with the in-situ querying context. Then we implemented a G-VOILA proof-of-concept using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. A follow-up user study (p = 16, scene = 2) demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving both higher objective score and subjective score, compared to a baseline without gaze data. We further conducted interviews and provided insights for future gaze-facilitated information querying systems.},

abstract = {The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new paradigm of search engines that use generative models to gather and summarize information to answer user queries. This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},

abstract = {Warning: this paper may contain content that is offensive or upsetting.Ethical and social risks persist as a crucial yet challenging topic in human-artificial Intelligence interactions, especially in ensuring the safe usage of natural language processing (NLP). The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT introduces the potential for exacerbating this concern. However, prior works on the ethics and risks of emergent LLMs either overlook the practical implications in real-world scenarios, lag behind rapid NLP advancements, lack user consensus on ethical risks, or fail to holistically address the entire spectrum of ethical considerations. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate, qualitatively explore and catalog ethical dilemmas and risks in ChatGPT through benchmarking with eight representative datasets and red teaming involving diverse case studies. Our findings show that while ChatGPT demonstrates superior safety performance on benchmark datasets, its guardrails can be bypassed via our manually curated examples, revealing not only the limitations of current benchmarks for risk assessment but also unexplored risks in five distinct scenarios, including social bias in code generation, bias in cross-lingual question answering, toxic language in personalized dialogue, misleading information from hallucination, and prompt injections for unethical behaviors. We conclude with implications from red teaming ChatGPT and recommendations for designing future responsible large language models.},

AAMAS is the flagship conference of the non-profit International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).We are happy that the 2025 edition of AAMAS will be coming to Detroit, MI. Previous editions were held in Bologna (2002), Melbourne (2003), New York (2004), Utrecht (2005), Hakodate (2006), Honolulu (2007), Estoril (2008), Budapest (2009), Toronto (2010), Taipei (2011), Valencia (2012), Saint Paul (2013), Paris (2014), Istanbul (2015), Singapore (2016), S\~{a}o Paulo (2017), Stockholm (2018), Montr\'{e}al (2019), Auckland/online (2020), London/online (2021), Auckland/online (2022), London (2023), and Auckland (2024).The main track of the conference includes peer-reviewed technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems, divided into the following areas of interest:Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE)Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS)Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS)Modeling and Simulation of Societies (SIM)Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)Robotics and Control (ROBOT)Innovative Applications (IA)As in previous years, we worked with a three-tier program committee, consisting of 29 area chairs, 147 senior program committee members, and over 600 regular program committee members. Their work was supported by a substantial number of auxiliary reviewers. When composing the committee, we followed the tradition of AAMAS of not having anyone serve in a senior programme committee or area chair role for more than two years in a row, and we were pleased to see that many senior colleagues accepted our invitation to serve as regular programme committee members.For the main track, we received a total of 1361 abstract submissions. Some didn't materialize while a number of others were desk-rejected (mostly due to anonymity violations and similar infringements of the rules laid down in the Call for Papers). The program committee then reviewed the remaining 1021 submissions. Almost all submissions received at least three reviews, as well as a meta-review summarizing the assessment of the program committee. Authors had the opportunity to respond to initial versions of their reviews during a rebuttal phase, and the rebuttal phase additional gave the authors and reviewers an opportunity to engage in further discussion.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.}

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been playing a crucial role in drug discovery, mainly through quantitative structure-activity relationship models that relate molecular structures to properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. However, traditional ML approaches often lack customisation to a particular biochemical task and fail to generalise to new biochemical spaces, resulting in reduced predictive performance. Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged to address these limitations by automatically selecting the suitable ML pipelines for a given input dataset. Despite its potential, AutoML is underutilised in cheminformatics, and its decisions often lack interpretability, reducing user trust - especially among non-experts. Accordingly, this paper proposes an evolutionary AutoML method for biochemical property prediction that outputs an interpretable model for understanding the evolved ML pipelines. It combines grammar-based genetic programming with Bayesian networks to guide search and enhance the searched pipelines' interpretability. The evaluation on 12 benchmark ADMET datasets showed that the proposed AutoML method obtained similar or better results than three existing methods. Additionally, the interpretable Bayesian network identified, among the ML pipelines' components generated by the AutoML method (i.e. components like biochemical feature extraction methods, preprocessing techniques and ML algorithms), which components affect the ML pipelines' predictive performance.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons open up a unique interaction space that seamlessly integrates users’ body movements with robotic actuation. Despite its potential, human-exoskeleton interaction remains an underexplored area in HCI, largely due to the lack of accessible prototyping tools that enable designers to easily develop exoskeleton designs and customized interactive behaviors. We present ExoKit, a do-it-yourself toolkit for rapid prototyping of low-fidelity, functional exoskeletons targeted at novice roboticists. ExoKit&nbsp;includes modular hardware components for sensing and actuating shoulder and elbow joints, which are easy to fabricate and (re)configure for customized functionality and wearability. To simplify the programming of interactive behaviors, we propose functional abstractions that encapsulate high-level human-exoskeleton interactions. These can be readily accessed either through ExoKit’s command-line or graphical user interface, a Processing library, or microcontroller firmware, each targeted at different experience levels. Findings from implemented application cases and two usage studies demonstrate the versatility and accessibility of ExoKit&nbsp;for early-stage interaction design.},

abstract = {High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools offer rapid hardware design from C code, but their compatibility is limited by code constructs. This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically refactoring C code into HLS-compatible formats. We present a case study using an LLM to rewrite C code for NIST 800-22 randomness tests, a QuickSort algorithm, and AES-128 into HLS-synthesizable C. The LLM iteratively transforms the C code guided by the system prompt and tool’s feedback, implementing functions like streaming data and hardware-specific signals. With the hindsight obtained from the case study, we implement a fully automated framework to refactor C code into HLS-compatible formats using LLMs. To tackle complex designs, we implement a preprocessing step that breaks down the hierarchy in order to approach the problem in a divide-and-conquer bottom-up way. We validated our framework on three ciphers, one hash function, five NIST 800-22 randomness tests, and a QuickSort algorithm. Our results show a high success rate on benchmarks that are orders of magnitude more complex than what has been achieved generating Verilog with LLMs.},

This workshop is dedicated to bridging the use of principled computer science towards positive climate and biodiversity actions. This year's edition follows a successful 1st workshop held at POPL 2024 in London, which had over 100 participants attend at the Institute of Engineering and Technology in London, UK.    There are simultaneous interlinked crises across the planet due to human actions: climate change, biodiversity loss, and desertification. Addressing these challenges requires, amongst other things, a global understanding of the present state of affairs and the effectiveness of our adaptations and mitigations, leveraging both data and computation.    However, programming the computer systems required to effectively ingest, clean, collate, process, explore, archive, and derive policy decisions from the planetary data we are collecting is difficult and leads to artefacts presently not usable by non-CS-experts, not reliable enough for scientific and political decision making, and not widely and openly available to all interested parties. Concurrently, domains where computational techniques are already central (e.g., climate modelling) are facing diminishing returns from current hardware trends and software techniques.    PROPL explores how to close the gap between state-of-the-art programming methods being developed in academia and the use of programming in climate analysis, modelling, forecasting, policy, and diplomacy. The aim is to build bridges to the current practices used in the scientific community.},

abstract = {Summarization is one of the important tasks of natural language processing used to distill information. Recently, the sequence-to-sequence method was applied, in a general manner, to summarization tasks. The problem is that a large amount of information must be pre-trained for a specific domain, and information other than input statements cannot be utilized. To compensate for this shortcoming, controllable summarization has recently been in the spotlight. We introduced three properties into controllable summarization: 1) a new human-machine communication input format, 2) a robust constraint-sensitive summarization method for these formats, and 3) a practical interactive summarization interface available to the user. Experiments on the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset show that applying this input format and the constraint-sensitive method enhances summarization performance compared to the typical method. A user study shows that the interactive summarization interface is practical and that participants are evaluating it positively.},

abstract = {Traditional recommender systems rely on high-dimensional (latent) embeddings for modeling user-item interactions, often resulting in opaque representations that lack interpretability. Moreover, these systems offer limited control to users over their recommendations. Inspired by recent work, we introduce TExtuAl Representations for Scrutable recommendations (TEARS) to address these challenges. Instead of representing a user's interests through a latent embedding, TEARS encodes them in natural text, providing transparency and allowing users to edit them. To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user summaries based on user preferences. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we use an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with the learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering. We find this approach can surpass the performance of popular VAE models while providing user-controllable recommendations. We also analyze the controllability of TEARS through three simulated user tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of a user editing its summary. A more detailed version of this manuscript with more experiments, baselines and detail is provided on arXiv.},

However, when knowledge is key for such results, as is the case for tasks such as question answering and fact checking, massive parameter counts to store knowledge seem to be needed. Retrieval-augmented models are known to excel at knowledge intensive tasks without the need for as many parameters, but it is unclear whether they work in few-shot settings. In this work we present Atlas, a carefully designed and pre-trained retrieval-augmented language model able to learn knowledge intensive tasks with very few training examples. We perform evaluations on a wide range of tasks, including MMLU, KILT and Natural Questions, and study the impact of the content of the document index, showing that it can easily be updated. Notably, Atlas reaches over 42% accuracy on Natural Questions using only 64 examples, outperforming a 540B parameter model by 3% despite having 50x fewer parameters.},

However, the open-ended nature of text as interaction is double-edged; while users can input anything and have access to an infinite range of generations, they also must engage in brute-force trial and error with the text prompt when the result quality is poor. We conduct a study exploring what prompt keywords and model hyperparameters can help produce coherent outputs. In particular, we study prompts structured to include subject and style keywords and investigate success and failure modes of these prompts. Our evaluation of 5493 generations over the course of five experiments spans 51 abstract and concrete subjects as well as 51 abstract and figurative styles.

abstract = {Self-tracking can help personalize self-management interventions for chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), but reflecting on personal data requires motivation and literacy. Machine learning (ML) methods can identify patterns, but a key challenge is making actionable suggestions based on personal health data. We introduce GlucoGoalie, which combines ML with an expert system to translate ML output into personalized nutrition goal suggestions for individuals with T2D. In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants’ self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts. We discuss implications for ML-based interventions and the need for systems that offer more interactivity, feedback, and negotiation.},

abstract = {Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).},

abstract = {Finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to unseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation, RealToxicityPrompts). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PaLM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks (at time of release), such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled zero-shot performance on various natural language processing tasks. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.

Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation, ignoring that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), as a key building block for combinatorial tasks, either directly as solvers or by enhancing exact solvers. The inductive bias of GNNs effectively encodes combinatorial and relational input due to their invariance to permutations and awareness of input sparsity. This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, aiming at optimization and machine learning researchers.},

Our research, beginning with a formative study involving 53 participants, has pinpointed the primary accessibility barriers in video-based e-learning: mismatches in user pace, complex visual arrangements leading to unclear focus, and difficulties in navigating content. To tackle these barriers, we introduced SmartLearn (SL), an innovative tool designed to enhance the accessibility of video content. SL utilizes advanced video analysis techniques to address issues of focus, navigation, and pacing, enabling users to interact with video segments more effectively through a web interface. A subsequent evaluation demonstrated that SL significantly enhances user engagement, ease of access, and learnability over existing approaches. We conclude by presenting design guidelines derived from our study, aiming to promote future efforts in research and development towards a more inclusive digital education landscape.},

abstract = {The stylistic properties of text have intrigued computational linguistics researchers in recent years. Specifically, researchers have investigated the text style transfer task (TST), which aims to change the stylistic properties of the text while retaining its independent content of style. Over the last few years, many novel TST algorithms have been developed, while the industry has leveraged these algorithms to enable exciting TST applications. The field of TST research has developed because of this symbiosis. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on text style transfer. More concretely, we create a taxonomy to organize the TST models, and provide a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. We review existing evaluation methodologies for TST tasks and conduct a large-scale reproducibility study in which we experimentally benchmark 19 state-of-the-art TST algorithms on two publicly available datasets. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives on the new and exciting developments in the TST field.},

Seminal Graphics Papers Volume 2, perhaps more than any other activity undertaken in this milestone year, celebrates ACM SIGGRAPH's origins and continued success as a Technical and Professional Society. This collection of papers typifies the ground-breaking research that has been the conference's hallmark since 1974. A quick scan of the chapter and the paper titles shows just how far SIGGRAPH research has pushed the boundaries of our discipline and contributed to its evolution.The ACM Digital Library team has been supportive of this Seminal Graphics Papers project from the beginning.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular paradigm for addressing sequential decision tasks in which the agent has only limited environmental feedback. Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL) in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL curriculum learning research.},

Our position is that we need to revisit how we design and implement benchmarks. The SPEC benchmark offers interesting perspectives that our community should consider.

abstract = {Welcome to the second volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is dedicated to the 2024 summer review cycle.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, many of which were discussed in the previous message from program chairs in Volume 1. Here, to avoid repetition, we assume that readers have already read the latter message and will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous one. These include: (1) developing and utilizing an automated format violation identifier script focused on uncovering disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (2) incorporating authors-declared best-matching topics into our review assignment process; (3) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings, which necessitated additional managerial involvement in online dissensions; and (4) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it, and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Key statistics of the ASPLOS'24 summer cycle include: 409 submissions were finalized (about 1.5x more than last year's summer count and nearly 2.4x more than our spring cycle), with 107 related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 97 to machine learning, 88 to storage/memory, 80 to security, and 69 to datacenter/cloud; 179 (44%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 54 (13.2%) papers were accepted (with 20 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 33 (8.1%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions, of which 27 were subsequently accepted during the fall cycle (with 13 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 1,499 reviews were uploaded; and 5,557 comments were generated during online discussions.Analyzing the per-submission most-related broader areas of research, which we asked authors to associate with their work in the submission form, revealed that 71%, 47%, and 28% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, with about 45% being "interdisciplinary" submissions (associated with more than one area).

abstract = {Kubernetes has emerged as a prominent open-source platform for managing cloud applications, including stateful databases. These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.},

This conference focuses on multimedia information retrieval with a wide spectrum of topics ranging from multimedia/multimodal content understanding and learning, multimedia/multimodal information search and retrieval, multimedia/multimodal data security and processing, all the way to analysis and understanding of community-contributed social data, lifelogging data and automatically generated sensor data, integration of diverse multimodal data, and deep learning-based methodology and practical multimedia applications.For the conference regular program, we have received a record-breaking number of 515 submissions to the full paper track and another 81 submissions to the short paper track. The submissions were from all over the world. The program committee, led by the program chairs, has done a fabulous job in managing the reviewing process. Each submission received at least 2 independent reviews. In the borderline cases, additional reviews were sought in order to reach a fair decision. After a rigorous review process, we have accepted 211 long papers, resulting in an acceptance rate of 41%, and 35 short papers as posters with 43% acceptance rate. We would like to send our warm congratulations to the authors of all the accepted papers and thank the program committee members and reviewers who help evaluate the submissions. The regular program of the conference consists of oral presentations of the full papers and spotlight presentations of the short papers together with the poster presentations.In addition to the regular program, the conference also has a wide variety of other technical and social events. The technical program includes the new brave ideas session selected from all the submissions that are considered to have new and brave ideas, a panel discussion that focuses on a hot topic with perspectives from a group of leaders in this community, and a session for reproducibility where accepted papers and demos are presented with the focus on the principle and consensus of transparency, repeatability, and rigorous validation of multimedia research. Of course, the regular program offers keynote speeches from well-known leaders to provide their insight and inspiration to the audience.On the first day of the conference, before the regular program begins, we have two tutorials and four workshops covering a diverse range of topics related to multimedia retrieval and search.The social events of this conference include a welcome reception open to all the conference attendees, a gala dinner in a night of the conference with a cruise on the Chicago River at the downtown of Chicago in which we shall announce the winners of the best paper award and the best student paper award, and the exhibition booths open to all the attendees from leading industrial partners and publishers.},

This conference series has been founded to foster novel and exciting research in the data and application security and privacy arena and to help generate new directions for further research and development. The initial concept was established by the two co-founders, Elisa Bertino and Ravi Sandhu, and sharpened by subsequent discussions with several fellow data security and privacy researchers. Their enthusiastic encouragement persuaded the co-founders to move ahead with the always daunting task of creating a high-quality conference. CODASPY has become a leading forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on hardware and software security. The conference gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of data and applications security and privacy.This year, the call for papers attracted 165 submissions from 32 different countries, resulting in accepted papers from Asia, Europe, and North America. The submitted papers were peer reviewed and subsequently discussed based on their novelty, quality, and contribution by the members of the Program Committee. The submissions were double blind, and all the members of the Program Committee had access to all the submissions and their reviews at all times to facilitate discussion among the members. The submission and the review process were done using Easychair, a web-based software system. Based on the reviews and discussion, 31 Full Research Papers and 8 Dataset/Tool papers were accepted of the 165 total submissions for an overall acceptance rate of 23%.},

The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation. We describe a formalization of the robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes existing research into a single coherent framework and highlight the many remaining research opportunities and challenges.},

They may also inadvertently violate copyright laws by mimicking code protected by restrictive licenses. We argue for the importance of tracking the provenance of AI-generated code in the software supply chain, so that adequate controls can be put in place to mitigate risks. For that, it is necessary to have techniques that can distinguish between human- and AI-generate code, and we conduct a case study in regards to whether such techniques can reliably work. We evaluate the effectiveness of lexical and syntactic features for distinguishing AI- and human-generated code on a standardized task. Results show accuracy up to 92%, suggesting that the problem deserves further investigation.},

abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540- billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model (PaLM).We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

Their needs are often not adequately considered in the design of general platforms and they can be exposed to intra-community harms on LGBTQ+ specific platforms such as dating apps. To explore how social platform design could be improved to better support the needs of queer young men, we conducted a co-design study. We recruited 13 queer men working in technology design to generate new concepts for social platform features. We then refined these concepts and evaluated them in group sessions with end users, a different cohort of 15 queer young men. Here we present mockups of the concepts and findings from evaluations. Our findings show specific ways that providing more agency to social platform users could improve their experiences and we discuss implications for design.},

To address this problem, we present a novel mobile career guidance method: It enables users to remotely gain an impression of different work routines by receiving several short, scheduled chat messages from a persona throughout the day. These messages were previously collected from real professionals reporting on their tasks over a week. We implemented a smartphone application to compare our message-based approach to a traditional blog entry in a two-week within-subject field study (N = 17). Users highlighted that the scheduled messages (1) enhanced their understanding of work routines by integrating career information into their own daily context and (2) offered authentic insights into the jobs. We discuss design implications for mobile career guidance systems and future opportunities for presenting chunks of information in a temporal context.},

abstract = {Over the next five years, AI-powered tools likely will be helping developers in many diverse tasks. For example, such models may be used to improve code review, directing reviewers to parts of a change where review is most needed or even directly providing feedback on changes. Models such as Codex may suggest fixes for defects in code, build failures, or failing tests. These models are able to write tests automatically, helping to improve code quality and downstream reliability of distributed systems. This study of Copilot shows that developers spend more time reviewing code than actually writing code. As AI-powered tools are integrated into more software development tasks, developer roles will shift so that more time is spent assessing suggestions related to the task than doing the task itself.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions of people around the world, leading to a worldwide panic that has fueled the rapid and widespread dissemination of COVID-19-related disinformation on social media. The phenomenon, described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an "indodemic" presents a serious challenge to governments and public health authorities, but the spread of misinformation has made human detection less efficient than the rate of spread. While there have been many studies developing automated detection techniques for COVID-19 fake news, the results often refer to high accuracy but rarely to model detection time. This research uses fuzzy theory to extract features and uses multiple deep learning model frameworks to detect Chinese and English COVID-19 misinformation. With the reduction of text features, the detection time of the model is significantly reduced, and the model accuracy does not drop excessively. This study designs two different feature extraction methods based on fuzzy classification and compares the results with different deep learning models. BiLSTM was found to provide the best detection results for COVID-19 misinformation by directly using deep learning models, with 99% accuracy in English and 86% accuracy in Chinese. Applying fuzzy clustering to English COVID-19 fake news data features maintains 99% accuracy while reducing detection time by 10%. For Chinese misinformation, detection time is reduced by 15% at the cost of an 8% drop in accuracy.},

On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.This evolution, and the desire to further improve it, motivated the creation of FormaliSE: a well-established annual conference whose main goal is to promote work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. The collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.},

abstract = {As a dynamic programming language, Python has become increasingly popular in recent years. Although the dynamic type system of Python facilitates the developers in writing Python programs, it also brings type errors at run-time which are prevalent yet not easy to fix. There exist rule-based approaches for automatically repairing Python type errors. The approaches can generate accurate patches for the type errors covered by manually defined templates, but they require domain experts to design patch synthesis rules and suffer from low template coverage of real-world type errors. Learning-based approaches alleviate the manual efforts in designing patch synthesis rules and have become prevalent due to the recent advances in deep learning. Among the learning-based approaches, the prompt-based approach which leverages the knowledge base of code pre-trained models via pre-defined prompts, obtains state-of-the-art performance in general program repair tasks. However, such prompts are manually defined and do not involve any specific clues for repairing Python type errors, resulting in limited effectiveness. How to automatically improve prompts with the domain knowledge for type error repair is challenging yet under-explored.In this paper, we present TypeFix, a novel prompt-based approach with fix templates incorporated for repairing Python type errors. TypeFix first mines generalized fix templates via a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm. The identified fix templates indicate the common edit patterns and contexts of existing type error fixes. TypeFix then generates code prompts for code pre-trained models by employing the generalized fix templates as domain knowledge, in which the masks are adaptively located for each type error instead of being pre-determined. Experiments on two benchmarks, including BugsInPy and TypeBugs, show that TypeFix successfully repairs 26 and 55 type errors, outperforming the best baseline approach by 9 and 14, respectively. Besides, the proposed fix template mining approach can cover 75% of developers' patches in both benchmarks, increasing the best rule-based approach PyTER by more than 30%.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.   This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area.    Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors.    These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}

To address this problem, there has been a great deal of research on algorithmically-efficient deep learning, which seeks to reduce training costs not at the hardware or implementation level, but through changes in the semantics of the training program. In this paper, we present a structured and comprehensive overview of the research in this field. First, we formalize the algorithmic speedup problem, then we use fundamental building blocks of algorithmically efficient training to develop a taxonomy. Our taxonomy highlights commonalities of seemingly disparate methods and reveals current research gaps. Next, we present evaluation best practices to enable comprehensive, fair, and reliable comparisons of speedup techniques. To further aid research and applications, we discuss common bottlenecks in the training pipeline (illustrated via experiments) and offer taxonomic mitigation strategies for them. Finally, we highlight some unsolved research challenges and present promising future directions.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {The ability to edit 3D assets with natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying exact manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets with natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting these parameters allows users to explore shape variations with exact control over the magnitude of the edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, we find that although LLMs excel at identifying the initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, resulting in outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally, we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.},

This success can be partly attributed to the advancements made in the sub-fields of AI such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Much of the growth in these fields has been made possible with deep learning, a sub-area of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. This has created significant interest in the integration of vision and language. In this survey, we focus on ten prominent tasks that integrate language and vision by discussing their problem formulation, methods, existing datasets, evaluation measures, and compare the results obtained with corresponding state-of-the-art methods. Our efforts go beyond earlier surveys which are either task-specific or concentrate only on one type of visual content, i.e., image or video. Furthermore, we also provide some potential future directions in this field of research with an anticipation that this survey stimulates innovative thoughts and ideas to address the existing challenges and build new applications.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely deployed in security-critical artificial intelligence systems, such as autonomous driving and facial recognition systems. However, recent research has revealed their susceptibility to Trojan information maliciously injected by attackers. This vulnerability is caused, on the one hand, by the complex architecture and non-interpretability of DNNs. On the other hand, external open-source datasets, pre-trained models, and intelligent service platforms further exacerbate the threat of Trojan attacks. This article presents the first comprehensive survey of Trojan attacks against DNNs from a life-cycle perspective, including training, post-training, and inference (deployment) stages. Specifically, this article reformulates the relationships of Trojan attacks with poisoning attacks, adversarial example attacks, and bit-flip attacks. Then, research on Trojan attacks against newly emerged model architectures (e.g., vision transformers and spiking neural networks) and in other research fields is investigated. Moreover, this article also provides a comprehensive review of countermeasures (including detection and elimination) against Trojan attacks. Further, it evaluates the practical effectiveness of existing defense strategies against Trojan attacks at different lifecycle stages. Finally, we conclude the survey and provide constructive insights to advance research on Trojan attacks and countermeasures.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

abstract = {Knowledge bases, such as Google knowledge graph, contain millions of entities (people, places, etc.) and billions of facts about them. While much is known about entities, little is known about the actions these entities relate to. On the other hand, the Web has lots of information about human tasks. A website for restaurant reservations, for example, implicitly knows about various restaurant-related actions (making reservations, delivering food, etc.), the inputs these actions require and their expected output; it can also be automated to execute those actions. To harvest action knowledge from websites, we propose Etna. Users demonstrate how to accomplish various tasks in a website, and Etna constructs an action-state model of the website visualized as an action graph. An action graph includes definitions of tasks and actions, knowledge about their start/end states, and execution scripts for their automation. We report on our experience in building action-state models of many commercial websites and use cases that leveraged them.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation on various state-of-the-art models for text classification, including a word-based CNN, a character-based CNN and an LSTM. As an example of our results, we show that the accuracy of character-based convolutional networks drops to the level of random selection by modifying only five characters through Greedy Attack.},

abstract = {Developing techniques to infer the behavior of networked social systems has attracted a lot of attention in the literature. Using a discrete dynamical system to model a networked social system, the problem of inferring the behavior of the system can be formulated as the problem of learning the local functions of the dynamical system. We investigate the problem assuming an active form of interaction with the system through queries. We consider two classes of local functions (namely, symmetric and threshold functions) and two interaction modes, namely batch (where all the queries must be submitted together) and adaptive (where the set of queries submitted at a stage may rely on the answers to previous queries). We establish bounds on the number of queries under both batch and adaptive query modes using vertex coloring and probabilistic methods. Our results show that a small number of appropriately chosen queries are provably sufficient to correctly learn all the local functions. We develop complexity results which suggest that, in general, the problem of generating query sets of minimum size is computationally intractable. We present efficient heuristics that produce query sets under both batch and adaptive query modes. Also, we present a query compaction algorithm that identifies and removes redundant queries from a given query set. Our algorithms were evaluated through experiments on over 20 well-known networks.},

However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.},

abstract = {This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to interpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data compression and discriminative representation. We argue that for high-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative representation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset and the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a multi-layer deep network, named ReduNet, which shares common characteristics of modern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear operators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed layer-by-layer via forward propagation, although they are amenable to fine-tuning via back propagation. All components of so-obtained "white-box" network have precise optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation in the invariant setting suggests a trade-off between sparsity and invariance, and also indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary simulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate reduction objective and the associated ReduNet.},

Many versions of this problem, for different query languages, were studied in database theory. In this paper we solve a problem stated in [CGLV02] and show that Query Determinacy Problem is undecidable for the Regular Path Queries -- the paradigmatic query language of graph databases.},

abstract = {Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 -- officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},
